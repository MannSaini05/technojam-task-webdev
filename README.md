# technojam-task-webdev
I am Mann Saini from Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh but living in Greater noida since my birth. My intrest is in coding which makes intresting for me to learn new languages, I can code in c, java, python, html, and css. I did around 1 1/2 half task , I completed my figma clone create task. Figma was new to me but it didnt took long for me to adapt to it but the problem I faced was colour scheme and all beacuse i suck at that but yeah with time and working on such apps I will improve for sure beause I loved creating it. Next I tired to create weather application using react whcih is almost 60% complete api of weather is installed but you can view just 1 city which i added and might be able to do more which you will see but i am writing this earlier so I dont know howw much i will be able to complete.
